# Yuede Ji
{% include social.html %}

&nbsp;

Welcome! Iâ€™m Yuede Ji, a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the George Washington University. It's my great honor to be advised by [Prof. H. Howie Huang](https://csl.seas.gwu.edu). Prior to joining GWU, I received my B.S., M.S. from College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, advised by [Prof. Qiang Li](http://cs.jlu.edu.cn/?mod=teacher&act=view&id=69).

My research interests are mainly in High Performance Computing, Computer and Network Security. Currently, I am researching on graph computation and GPU.
