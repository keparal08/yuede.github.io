## About me
I am a Ph.D. student from the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gwu.edu) at [The George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu). It's my great honor to be advised by [Prof. Howie Huang](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/howie-huang). Prior to joining GWU, I received my B.E., M.S. from College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, advised by [Prof. Qiang Li](http://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1026/6668.htm).

My research interests are mainly in High Performance Computing, Computer and Network Security. Currently, I am researching on graph-centric security and computation.
