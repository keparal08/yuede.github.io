# Yuede (YD) Ji
{% include social.html %}

&nbsp;

Welcome! Iâ€™m Yuede (YD) Ji, a PhD student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the George Washington University. It's my great honor to be advised by [Prof. H. Howie Huang](https://csl.seas.gwu.edu). Prior to joining GWU, I received my B.S., M.S. from College of Computer Science and Technology, Jilin University, advised by Prof. Qiang Li.

My research interests are mainly in High Performance Computing, Computer and Network Security. Currently, I am researching on graph computation and GPU.
