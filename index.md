# Yuede Ji 
{% include social.html %}

<strong>Openings:</strong> I am looking for multiple self-motivated students (including Ph.D., master, undergraduate, and intern) and visitors to work with me on various cool projects in cybersecurity, high-performance computing, graph learning, and graph analytics. If you are interested, please drop me an email with your CV.

## Bio

Yuede Ji will be joining the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/) at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/) as an Assistant Professor in Fall 2021.
Right now, Yuede Ji is a Ph.D. candidate from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The George Washington University. He is advised by [Prof. H. Howie Huang](https://www.seas.gwu.edu/howie-huang). Prior to joining GWU, he received B.E., M.S. from Jilin University, advised by [Prof. Qiang Li](http://ccst.jlu.edu.cn/info/1026/6668.htm).

Yuede Ji's research interest is at the intersection of <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, <strong>High-Performance Computing</strong>, <strong>Graph Learning</strong>, and <strong>Graph Analytics</strong>.
On one hand, he aims to build efficient systems to protect the emerging data and computing devices from various layers, such as vulnerability detection, malware detection, and network threat detection.
On the other hand, he aims to build high-performance computing systems with emerging hardware (e.g., GPU) for cybersecurity related techniques, such as graph learning and graph analytics.
