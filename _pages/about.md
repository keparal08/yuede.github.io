Dr. Yuede Ji is an Assistant Professor from the [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/) at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/).
He directs the <strong>Graph Lab</strong>, which focuses on <strong>graph-centric security, learning, and computing</strong>.
We work at the intersections of High-Performance Computing (HPC), Security, Graph AI, and Graph Algorithms. The goal of our research is to build effective and scalable system solutions to protect the security and privacy of critical software and HPC infrastructures. Our research work has frequently appeared at prestigious security and HPC venues, including SC, HPDC, USENIX Security, ISSTA, EuroS&P, RAID, and AsiaCCS.
Our research has won the <strong>best paper award at NPC 2014</strong>, and the <strong>best poster award at SMCDC 2023</strong>. My research has been supported by multiple grants <strong>totaling over \$1.2M</strong> from National Science Foundation (NSF), Department of Energy (DOE), and Google.

Dr. Yuede Ji received a Ph.D. degree from the George Washington University in 2021 working with [Dr. Howie Huang](https://www2.seas.gwu.edu/~howie/). He received M.S. and B.E. from Jilin University in 2015 and 2012, respectively. 

Openings
======
Dr. Ji is looking for fully funded self-motivated Ph.D. students to work on various cool projects in cybersecurity, high-performance computing, and graph AI. If you are interested, please drop me an email with your CV. According to CS ranking, UNT is ranked <strong>41st</strong> among all the US Universities in the discipline of <strong>HPC</strong> (as of Dec. 2023).
