## 1. Social Botnet 

Social botnet is a novel botnet which can spread on online social networs (OSNs), use OSN as command and control (C&C) channel, and leverage the popularity and specialities of OSN to perform malicious activities. In this project, we try to unveil the special features of social botnet and detect them more efficiently. For this project, we would like to share the source codes, binaries, and traces. Due to the specialities of security research, they can only be used for research purposes.

1. The social botnet source codes and binaries can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/rboxrb4wf0opxsz/AAC9Y4HyeXf7s8o9i1tr2lAba?dl=0) on Dropbox. 

2. However, the traces have a huge size which is shared [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1c0fix00) using Baidu Clound.

If you used them, please cite the follwing papers.
